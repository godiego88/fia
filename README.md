# FIA – Financial Intelligence Agent

This repository contains the **bare-bones project structure** for FIA.

At this stage:
- No automation runs.
- No API keys are used.
- No GitHub Actions are active.
- Only the directory framework is established.

## Current Repository Structure

/ (root)
README.md
.gitignore
/runners
/brains
/config
/docs
/.github/workflows

## Next Steps
We will gradually add:
- Supabase schema
- Configuration files
- GitHub Secrets (as empty placeholders)
- Basic Python scaffolding
- Eventually GitHub Actions (disabled for now)
